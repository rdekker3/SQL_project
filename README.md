Code by Ryan Dekker;

Jupyter notebook file cleans the crowdfunding and contacts Excel files and exports them as CSV files;
  Used option 1 to use Python dictionary methods to take the contacts file to be converted to a dataframe;
    Had to adjust the header method from 2 to 3 due the heading of the contacts.xlsx file;

  
Used quickdatabasediagrams.com to create the database schema and converted it to an SQL file;
Uplaoded the SQL file to PostgreSQL and verified the queries worked.
